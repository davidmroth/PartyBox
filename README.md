Motivation:
  I created this project to entertain a party during the Christmas holiday. I had an old Xbox Rockband Stage Kit laying around that I was hoping I could use independently of the Xbox. This app basically allows you to run the Xbox Rockband Stage Kit (Light/Strobe/Fog Machine) using any Linux distribution running NodeJS. Its web based, so I can be controlled using any device using a web browser (supports mobile phones too).

  The NodeJS backend was hosted on a Raspberry Pi 2 with good great results. Due to the time crunch of working on this two days before the holiday, this is probably not considered full featured release. Also, there may be a few commands I did not implement or failed implement correctly. Doesn't matter, however, my goal was achieved and my party was a huge success. The Rockband kit added an element to the party that took things up a notch or two.


What's needed:
  Any Linux Distro (probably windows too with a little bit of work)
  NodeJS (and npm depdenancies)
  This project uses the Stage Kit API found here: https://github.com/jummama/stagekit


How to run:
  Clone this repo (git clone [this git url])
  To install all nodejs dependant modules (npm install)
